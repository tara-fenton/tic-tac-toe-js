# HOMEWORK: TIC TAC TOE

### Your Mission: Build Tic Tac Toe from scratch! ❌੦

Over the weekend, you will plan, pseudo code, and implement your first game!!!

This is a great stepping stone to creating your Unit One project and an excellent opportunity to plan and breakdown a problem first on paper, to understand its components before tackling the code.

## Before writing a line of code...

### We encourage you to 🤓:
*  Play the game with the neighbor while thinking of the game logic.
* Whiteboard **ALL** the components your game will require!
* Pseudocode the complete logic to the last step

### Things to think about 🤔:
- What is Tic Tac Toe? How is it played?
- What does it look like?
- How can you represent this programmatically?
- How can you use pseudocode to break down the functionality to the smallest piece?

Also, think about all the tools we've used so far:
- `strings`
- `numbers`
- `arrays`
- `objects`
- `functions`
- `booleans`
- `control flow structures`
- `DOM`

Which of these tools you are going to need to build this game?

## 🚀 Completion looks like:

- You have an `index.html`, a `main.js`, and a `style.css`. (Maybe also a `reset.css`? 🤔)
- Your tic-tac-toe is playable in the DOM
- Your tic-tac-toe can be won and lost
- You **must** use `.map`. `.filter`, **or** `.reduce`. (Suggestion: Make it work without using an array method first, then see where you can refactor it to include an array method.)
- Your game should be playable by 2 people taking turns 👍
- You've uploaded your completed tic tac toe game to [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com/)

## 🚀 Your homework submission should include:

- A pull request created on _this repo_.
- A link to your Tic Tac Toe on BitBalloon.
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due 🚨 11PM on SUNDAY NIGHT! 🚨
